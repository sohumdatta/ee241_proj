# A brief comparison of Asynchronous and Synchronous Digital Design Methods
### Sohum Datta, UC Berkeley

Welcome to my course project homepage for EE241B: Advanced Digital ICs in Spring 2017. This is a study Asynchronous Digital Design methods and how it fares against conventional synchronous methods on power, performance, area and ease of design. Have a look at the [proposal](EE241B_Proposal.pdf)!

I have uploaded the [midterm report](Midterm_report.pdf) which briefly introduces Asynchronous Circuit to people with EECS251 background and describes my experiment for the next phase. Have a look!

The Spring 2017 Term is coming to an end. The [presentation slides](doc/presentation_slides.pdf) and [final report](doc/main/main.pdf) are here!
