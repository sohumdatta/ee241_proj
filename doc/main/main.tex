\begin{abstract}
A simple experiment is described which compares synchronous and
asynchronous implementations of a three-stage integer pipeline.
The aim of the experiment was to replicate some results of similar previous
works and gain insights to the fundamental difference between the two
paradigms. The asynchronous implementation was about 19\% worse in area
and 64\% worse in throughput than the synchronous design.
A derivation of the Muller C gate based on latches and a
proof of linearity of the lower bound on energy scalability with the
entropy of specification of asynchronous circuits is also provided.

This document is self-contained for the experimental setup. A summary of
design methods for asynchronous processors is also provided.
However, the proofs in appendices are brief and important results used are only
stated without derivations.

\section{Introduction}

Asynchronous circuits have no clock. The sequencing of dependent computations
is done via \emph{handshaking}. 

The main advantage of asynchronous circuits is the inherent
\emph{slack-free} nature. The worst-case correctness behaviour for synchronous
systems is replaced by \emph{average}-case behaviour in asynchronous systems.

Synchronous circuits consume energy strongly related to the \emph{largest combinational
delay} in its path. By contrast, 
asynchronous circuits of large systems can be made to consume energy within a 
constant factor of the circuits entropy. A proof is outlined in Appendix B.

However, there are some serious pitfalls of this new paradigm.
For asynchronous circuits, Computer Aided Design (CAD) infrastructure is still in its infancy.
Estimating the average-case delay of a circuit 
is an NP-Hard problem \cite{seger_book}. It can also depend
on component delays in unexpected ways -- a faster gate can lead to overall
slower circuit! (For an example, please refer \cite{seger_book},
pg. 7). Finally, verification of asynchronous circuit can be very difficult 
\cite{async_test_survey}. A substantial family of circuit
classes cannot be tested for certain types of errors \cite{async_c_test}.

\section{Asynchronous Circuits on FPGA}

Prototyping asynchronous circuits on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
is a recent trend. As designers turn to explore asynchronous
circuits, the cheaper platform which is widely deployed in today's data-centers
serves better \cite{japan_fpga_paper}. Moreover, many modern systems features
(such as  Multi-Processor SoC, ARM IP Cores) can be easily
integrated with the  asynchronous circuit implemented.

There are several ways to design asynchronous circuits on commercial FPGAs 
\cite{japan_1} \cite{japan_2} \cite{japan_3} \cite{japan_4} \cite{japan_5}. An important choice is to
design Muller C Gate using FPGA resources. Appendix A describes the design
used.

\end{figure}

\section{Self-Timed Pipelines}

Self-timed pipelines ensure progress without the help of external signals
(clock). Unlike most modern processors where deep pipelines result
in large control overhead (synchronous stall signals), free elasticity in
asynchronous pipelines provide for data-driven throttling of speed and
power.

The basic micro-pipeline was developed by Ivan Sutherland (fig.
\ref{fig:micropipeline}) \cite{sutherland_cite}.
Its main pitfall is the fact that the pipeline evaluates 
\emph{at most half} of its stages at any instant.

Another family of self-timed circuits is composed of alternating computation and
interconnection blocks \cite{seger_book}. Computational blocks
use \emph{Dynamic Cascode Voltage Switch Logic} (DCVSL), a four-phase logic style,
and the interconnection blocks control handshaking.

A good reference for self-timed pipelines is \cite{micropipeline_cite}.

	Virtex-5.}

\end{figure}

\section{The Asynchronous Pipeline Setup}

A three-stage pipeline of an in-order RISCV32UI integer processor is
implemented. A synchronous and asynchronous
version of the same pipeline was written and compared. 
The asynchronous pipeline (as in fig. \ref{fig:pipeline}) has stage registers 
implemented by flip-flops but clocked by the micro-pipeline (fig.
\ref{fig:micropipeline}). Since the stage delays may be mis-matched, \emph{no
data forwarding or speculative execution} is performed in either design.

The EECS151: FPGA Lab resource Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA was used for the
experiments. Its basic assembly tests were used for verification and debugging, 
and the \texttt{mmult} program for benchmarking and comparing designs.

In order to implement the delay elements (DELAY0, ... DELAY3 in fig. \ref{fig:pipeline}), the
Virtex 5 primitive IODELAY was used. IODELAY can provide user-adjusted fixed
delay to Input/Output ports or to the internal fabric. The resolution of the
delay line used is about 31 ps. at 50 MHz control frequency. Fixed tap delay
requires the use control primitive IODELAYCTRL
(one each in 16 clock regions). 


\begin{figure} 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.5 \textwidth]{layout}
	\caption{The routed designs: asynchronous (left) and synchronous (right).} 
	\label{fig:layout}
\end{figure}



\section{Simulation Methodology}

Preliminary Static Timing Analysis (STA) without IODELAY primitives revealed
that stage delays went up to 3.8 ns (i.e. about 3 IODELAYs). Virtex 5 requires
\emph{all clock signals to be buffered} before being clocked into a latch.
Since the buffering is performed automatically (depending on the number of
clock domain crossings), the user cannot limit the distance between 
micro-pipeline gates and IODELAYs without manually routing the entire design.

This was a significant problem: a change in the number of IODELAYs for
a stage will change the routed design unpredictably. Hence, number of IODELAYs
for \emph{each stage} must be tuned correctly at once.

With a lack of alternatives, a manual iteration schedule was followed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Set the number of IODELAYs for each stage.
	\item Find out the stage delays after tool-flow using STA.
	\item If the pipeline path is \emph{within limits} of the delay provided 
		by the current number of IODELAYs for all
		stages, continue. 
		If for any path the STA delay is longer than the
		maximum delay provided by IODELAYS, increment the number of IODELAYs.
		If there are many such stages, increment for the stage with least 
		number of IODELAYs. Go to Step 2.
	\item If you have Static timining delays within the limits of IODELAYs, set
		the correct tap delay for each stage.
	\item Perform assembly tests. If fail, return to Step 1 with the stage with
		smallest total IODELAY delay incremented. If the IODELAYs are already at their
		maximum delay for that stage, a new IODELAY must be added. 
	\item Benchmark \texttt{mmult} to obtain the effective throughput.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Results}
Fig. \ref{fig:layout} shows the routed wires and SLICEs for the design.
The asynchronous design has more wires towards the left edge -- to connect to
IODELAYs forced to be at the chip (IO) boundary. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c c c c||} 
	\hline
	\textbf{Resource} & \textbf{Sync.} & \textbf{Async.} & \textbf{Change} \\ [0.5ex] 
	\hline\hline
	SLICE Regs. & 1413 & 1446 & +33 (23 \%) \\ 
	\hline
	SLICE LUTs & 2358 & 2395 & +37 (16 \%) \\
	\hline
	BUFG/BUFGCTRL & 2 & 5 & +3 \\
	\hline
	Throughput & 67.4 MIPS & 24.1 MIPS & - 43.3 (- 64 \%) \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Clearly, the \texttt{mmult} throughput of asynchronous design was lower than 50 
\% of synchronous since only half of the micro-pipeline can be full. 
Rest of the loss can be accounted for by over-estimation of IODELAY values
(due to manual tuning) and extra latency to IODELAY at the edge of chip.
\\

Xilinx ML505/6/7 development board does not have supply resistances to measure current. Hence,
power measurements could not be performed. The difficulties in
designing the asynchronous system on a commercial synchronous machine
highlights the mismatch between conventional tools and asynchronous design.
